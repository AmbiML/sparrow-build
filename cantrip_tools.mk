## Target to build the elfconvert utility
#
# Used in the CPIO bundling process, this tool converts ELF-formatted binaries
# into something directly loadable by CantripOS.
#
# See also the source code in $(ROOTDIR)/cantrip/tools/seL4/misc/elfconvert for
# more information.
elfconvert:
	cargo build -q \
        --manifest-path "$(ROOTDIR)/cantrip/tools/seL4/misc/elfconvert/Cargo.toml" \
        --target-dir "$(OUT)/host"

ELFCONVERT := $(OUT)/host/debug/elfconvert

%.app: %.elf | elfconvert
	$(ELFCONVERT) -f app -i $< -o $@

%.model: % | elfconvert
	$(ELFCONVERT) -f model -i $< -o $@

.PHONY:: elfconvert
